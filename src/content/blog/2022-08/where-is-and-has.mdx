# Using the where(), is(), and has() CSS pseudo classes

With the has() pseudo classing rolling out to browsers I've seen more talking about pseudo classes and ways to utilize them. To help myself better understand them I want to go over a few of the more recent ones, where(), is(), and has().

<CssHotness curPost="2" />

## where() and is()

Where() and is() are both pseudo classes that function almost identically. Both where() and is() take a list of selectors and then apply classes to the those selectors or to children under them.

```css
/* How we used to do this */
.post p,
.content p,
footer p {
	color blue
}

/* How it can be writtern now */
:where(.post, .content, footer) p {
	color: blue;
}

```

The difference in the two comes down to specificity. **where()** has **0** specificity and **is()** has the same specificity as the most specific item in the selector list.

### :where() example

:where()'s lack of specificity makes it a prime candidate for reset styles. You can see in this example that `.article p` overwrites the base `:where()` styles.

</iframe>

**Note** if you declare the `:where` block after declaring `footer p` the where will take specificity. Since element selectors have **0** specificity.

### :is() usage

:is() on the other hand can be a bit more tricky to override. In this example you will notice that `.article p` overwrites the base `:where()` styles, but `footer p` does not. That is because the `:is() ` block takes the specificity level of the **most specific selector** in the selector list.

<iframe
  height="500"
  style="width: 100%;"
  scrolling="no"
  title="Example of using :is()"
  src="https://codepen.io/craigwfox/embed/rNdWNLq?default-tab=css%2Cresult&theme-id=dark"
  frameborder="no"
  loading="lazy"
  allowtransparency="true"
  allowfullscreen="true"

In this case the most specific selector in the list is `.article p`. It is the more specific than `footer p` in the list because class selectors have more specificity than element selectors. Then it is also more specific than `.main p` since it comes second in the list.

## has()

For a long time people have been asking for a way to select an elements parent in CSS. For quite a while doing so would involve using JavaScript to find the element in question and then select its parentNode. Now you can (mostly) do this instead use has() in CSS.

To use has() you select an element/class and then check to see if a child/class/condition exists within it. In its simplest form you can for example check a section tag to see if a h2 is inside of it and if so make that background a different color than other section tags.

```css
section {
  background: red;
}

section:has(h2) {
  background: blue;
}
```

It's also possible to make more complex selectors by using other pseudo class. In this codepen example, I'm watching for when an a tag is hovered within a section and then am changing the background and text color.

  This example doesn't currently work in Firefox.

It's also possible to get even more crazy and do something such as Dave Rupert's solution to [styling dangling elements](https://daverupert.com/2022/07/solving-the-dangler-conundrum-with-has-and-container-queries/).

### Compatibility

A downside for has() is that it is still pretty new and only now starting to roll out into browsers. Currently only Chrome desktop and Safari (Desktop and iOS) support it without flags.

| Firefox | Chrome  | Edge | Safari | iOS   | Chrome Android | Firefox Android |
| ------- | ------- | ---- | ------ | ----- | -------------- | --------------- |
| None    | 105-106 | None | 15.4+  | 15.4+ | None           | None            |
