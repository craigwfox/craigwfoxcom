# Thoughts about **The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes**

I watched the movie not long after it came out, and with the sequel **Sunrise On The Reaping** coming out March 18, 2025 I figured I would give this a quick read. Overall it seems that the movie followed the book very closely, which is nice in someways, but made for a bit of a boring read.

While the original trilogy shows the view of the common people and their struggles over dictatorship this book focuses on Coriolanus Snow and how his experience led to his world views and definitely towards changing the games. It shows his attempt at loving another, but also shows how much he values his own ambitions over that love.
