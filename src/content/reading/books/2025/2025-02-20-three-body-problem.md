# Thoughts about The Three-Body Problem

- Found all the details about the Chinese Cultural Revolution really interesting and now want to find some books to learn a bit more about it.
- Lots of analogies to how the human race advances with little care for nature.
- Trisolarians:
  - Proxy for authoritarianism and monarchy rule
  - Their wanting to take over Earth could be seen as an analogy for:
    - Humanities affect on nature
    - The destruction and abuse of indigenous peoples through history
- The EOT are examples of a few things:
  - How the wealthy and "intellectuals" feel know more of what the world needs than everyone else. They make sweeping decisions for the"greater good" without a care of how the common man might feel or be affected.
  - How desperation and hopelessness can lead people to accept and even yearn for authoritarianism even to their own self destruction.
- The book ends with hope though. The message is that even if the odds seem insurmountable the many can adapt and overcome.
