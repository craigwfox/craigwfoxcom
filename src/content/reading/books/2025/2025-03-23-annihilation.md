# Thoughts about _Annihilation_

- Realized that I have watched this movie and didn't particularly like it. I have a hunch I will enjoy reading this more.
- Enjoyed the book much more than the movie. It might help that I know that the many many unanswered questions and curiosity of the world of Southern Reach/Area X will be sated somewhat by additional books.
