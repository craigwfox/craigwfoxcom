Solo hike on the Bench Road Trail on Mt Nebo

<figure>
  <blockquote>
    Begins at the overlook shelter visible in the drive up the
    mountain to the park. There is a narrow shelf called a bench that
    encircles the entire mountain. In the early 1900s, this bench
    featured a road. Today the bench is a trail route through a
    woodland that teems with large trees and wildlife. Fern Lake,
    remnants of historic springs, and steps that were a part of an
    early resort development are still visible. The trail is level in
    most places and offers views from the mountain, especially during
    seasons from late fall through early spring. For a map and more
    information, visit MTBProject.com.
