# I'm Craig Fox, front-end developer, maker, and geek

Currently I'm working for Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield as a front-end developer and I've been building websites for a bit over 10 years.

When building sites I try to make them usable and accessible. Over the years I've built websites using static site generators, WordPress, Vue, and React sites for companies large and small.

Outside of work I like to woodwork, 3d print, hike, read, and play video games.
