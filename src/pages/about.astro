  <h1>I'm Craig Fox, UX engineer, maker, and geek</h1>

  <p>
    Currently I'm working for Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield as a
    Senior frontend developer and I've been building websites for a
    bit over 10 years.
  </p>

  <p>
    When building sites I try to make them usable and accessible. Over
    the years I've built websites using static site generators,
    WordPress, Vue, and React sites for companies large and small.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of work I like to woodwork, 3d print, hike, read, and play
    video games.
