	<h1>I'm Craig Fox, UX engineer, maker, and geek</h1>

	<p>
		Currently I'm working for Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield as a
		Senior UX Engineer and I've been building websites for a bit over
		10 years.
	</p>

	<p>
		Currently I'm mostly working in Vue JS, but over the years I've
		built websites using static site generators, WordPress, and Vue
		for companies large and small.
	</p>

	<p>
		Outside of work I like to woodwork, 3d print, hike, read, and play
		video games.
