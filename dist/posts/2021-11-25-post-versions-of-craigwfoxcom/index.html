<h1>The versions of craigwfox.com</h1>
<h2>Version 1.0</h2>
<p>This was the first version of my personal site, it was meant to be a mix of a blog and a portfolio for my graphic design work.</p>

<h2>Version 2.0</h2>
<p>Version two was still meant to be a portfolio site for graphic design work. I remember being really proud of the rounded corners, I had learned that you could use positioned images to create them. So I was using them everywhere.</p>

<h2>Version 3.0</h2>
<p>I remember having fun sketching out the goofy illustrations. I think I had some inspiration from some of the fun things I had seen on CSS zen gardens.</p>

<h2>Version 4.0</h2>
<p>This version was done after working as a front-end developer at The Richland Group for about four years. It was my first go at using a static site generator (Jekyll) and was my first personal site I was really happy with. The other sites were fun, but the amount I had learned between those sites and this was was quite substantial.</p>

<h2>Version 5.0</h2>
<p>This was done over my Thanksgiving vacation in Nov 2021. I'd gotten tired of my old site's portfolio being so out of date and was really wanting to finally make a blog so I decided now was the time. I initially started with planning to keep it looking the same as the old site, but the urge to redo it all took over.</p>
