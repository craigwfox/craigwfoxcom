gatsby build

```bash
gatsby format
```

### Serve

## Todo

### RSS

- Add image to RSS feed
- Check over RSS feed data overall

### Landing

- Once I have 5-10 posts I want to make the posts the main feature of the page and move the about to an about page and just have a smaller about section to the right of the posts.
- Add work section back to the bottom where posts currently are once I have the few side projects I want finished.
- Maybe a featured pen section to show of a Codepen of mine that I like.
